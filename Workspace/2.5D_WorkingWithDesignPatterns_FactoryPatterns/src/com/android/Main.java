	 * 
	 *The Factory pattern is also refereed to as the Factory Method Pattern.
	 *
	 *How do we create objects in which the precise type of object is not known until runtime.
	 *Some method is needed in selecting which subclass to use.  
	 *(I.E subclass of Animal is lion and goat and determine at runtime that we will be creating a meat object to feed the lion).
	 *
	 *This is a creational pattern that uses a Factory class to produce instances of objects based on a set of imput parameters.
	 *Often implemented by using static methods, so do not need an instance of the factory class.
	 *Also considered good practice to postfix a word "Factory" to the end of the class name. IE "FoodFactory".
