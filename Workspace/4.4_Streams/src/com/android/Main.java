	 *A stream is NOT a data structure. I.e not an arrayList etc. 
	 *Instead it takes input from COLLECTIONS, ARRAYS or I/O CHANNELS, or we can generate data using iterate and generate.
	 *
	 *Streams dont usually change the original data structure (but they can).
	 * If its based on a list it will usually not change the original data, but it can.
